### Hi there 👋

- ## 🔭 I’m currently a college student from Taiwan.

- ## 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and major in mechanic engineering.

  ## ***My Interest***:
  # I am addicted to Japanese ACG. My favorite comic is `ONE PIECE`. About animation, I love `Made in Abyss`, `Pretty Derby` and `Fate Grand Order`.
  # Recently, I am watching Vtubers from Hololive, I can't find things which are more facinating than Vtubers. By the way, my oshi is `星街すいせい` from JP and `Nanashi Mumei` from EN.
